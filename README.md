# Advanced Statistical Analysis and Model-Based Learning IDC- Course Overview

## Course Overview

This course, **Advanced Statistical Analysis and Model-Based Learning**, explores various statistical methodologies and machine learning techniques. The focus is on understanding core statistical concepts, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, model validation, and their applications to real-world datasets.

The course covers both theoretical and practical aspects, with each homework focusing on different statistical techniques and methods, including linear regression, ANOVA, hypothesis testing, variable selection, and model validation. Students are required to apply these techniques to data analysis tasks using Python.

## Key Topics Covered Throughout the Course:

- **Statistical Estimation & Hypothesis Testing**
  - Confidence intervals
  - Two-sample tests
  - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
  
- **Linear and Nonlinear Regression**
  - Multiple regression
  - Sinusoidal regression
  - Least squares and weighted least squares

- **Model Selection & Validation**
  - Variable selection techniques (AIC, BIC, Lasso)
  - Cross-validation and model evaluation
  
- **Time Series & Fourier Series**
  - Fourier regression
  - Periodicity and trends in residuals
  
- **A/B Testing & Statistical Inference**
  - Z-statistics and hypothesis testing
  - Statistical inference with real-world data
